# ERNI Academy

[![ERNI Academy Social Banner](/assets/erni-social-banner-github.png)](https://betterask.erni)

Hello üëã ! We are ERNIans, developers and engineers building complex and smart solutions. Our main goal is to contribute and share our knowledge to the community.

## üåà Open Source at ERNI

At ERNI, we are open source believers, we use open source software and components to build solutions, and we want to give back to the community, sharing our expertise and being more open and transparent.

One of our goals as ERNIans is to bring high quality code and documentation to the community by sharing best practices and enhancing strong collaborations.

Doing open source software enables ERNIans to have an open portfolio of their work outside the internal projects that we do for our customers.

## üìΩ Streamings and webinars

We know that sometimes code doesn't speak for itself, so we try to do [Twitch sessions](https://www.twitch.tv/erni_academy) and webinars to help spread our knowledge in a closer, safer, and friendly way.

## üí° Tips for newcomers

Here at ERNI, we have our arms wide open for new contributions, and welcome any type of contribution (from small typos to big RFCs proposals) and want to extend our knowledge to all the community.

If you are new or less experienced in open source town, don't get scared, we are all here to learn from each other and to collaborate.

We have some tips to ease the collaboration:

- First of all, we recommend you to go and check the [`awesome-resources`](https://github.com/ERNI-Academy/awesome-resources) repository where you are going to find a list of projects and repositories grouped by context and themes (Backend, Frontend, Mobile, CyberSec, DevOps, QA‚Ä¶)

- Then if you want and are ready to collaborate, but don‚Äôt know where to start from, check for issues with the `good first issue` tag, those issues should be less challenging and usually they have a proposed solution.

## üöÄ We are hiring!

We are always hiring awesome people to [join our team](https://www.betterask.erni/all-jobs/).
